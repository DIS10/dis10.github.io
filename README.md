**HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript** were used in this project.

Bootstrap 4 "Neon Glow" Theme by HackerThemes was used and edited, https://hackerthemes.com

It is hosted on Github Pages, a free site hosting service. 

The site can be accessed at **https://dis10.github.io/**

The chosen topics in Discrete Structures 1 to be solved are
- *Intersection of Sets*
- *Union of Sets*
- *Set Difference*
- *Symmetric Difference*
- *Subsets*

## Discussion of the whole functionality of the program.

### Intersection of sets
In the intersection of sets, the user is asked to input two sets of data in their respective text fields. 

After inputting data, the user must click on the calculate button to execute the Javascript function **compute()**.

The result is displayed on the text field below the buttons. 

Example: 
**Set 1** is 1,2,3,4
**Set 2** is 3,4,6,7,8

The Javascript function will evaluate to **3,4** since they were the only intersecting elements in the 2 sets.


### Union of sets
In the union of sets, the user is asked to input two sets of data in their respective text fields. 

After inputting data, the user must click on the calculate button to execute the Javascript function **compute2()**. 

The result is displayed on the text field below the buttons. 

Example: 
**Set 1** is 1,2,3,4
**Set 2** is 3,4,6,7,8

The Javascript function will evaluate to **1,2,3,4,6,7,8** since it is the union of the 2 sets

### Set Difference
In the set difference, the user is asked to input two sets of data in their respective text fields. 

After inputting data, the user must click on the calculate button to execute the Javascript function **compute3()**.

The result is displayed on the text field below the buttons. 

Example: 
**Set 1** is 1,2,3,4
**Set 2** is 3,4,6,7,8

The Javascript function will evaluate to **1,2** since 3,4, the two set's intersecting elements, is subtracted from Set 1, leaving only 1,2.

### Symmetric Difference
In the symmetric difference, the user is asked to input two sets of data in their respective text fields. 

After inputting data, the user must click on the calculate button to execute the Javascript function **compute4()**.

The result is displayed on the text field below the buttons. 

Example: 
**Set 1** is 1,2,3,4
**Set 2** is 3,4,6,7,8

The Javascript function will evaluate to **1,2,6,7,8** since 3,4, the two set's intersecting elements, is subtracted from Set 1 and the remaining elements in Set 2 is added.


### Subsets
In the subsets, the user is asked to input two sets of data in their respective text fields. 

After inputting data, the user must click on the calculate button to execute the Javascript function **compute4()**.

The result is displayed on the text field below the buttons. 

Example: 
**Set 1** is 1,2,3,4
**Set 2** is 3,4,6,7,8

The Javascript function will evaluate to **is not a subset** since Set 2 has elements missing from Set 1.
